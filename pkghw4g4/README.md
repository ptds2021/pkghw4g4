pkghw4g4 provide an approximation of the area of a Shape by using Monte Carlo Approach, with the function estimate_area(), we can simulate coordinates of x and y , which are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 according to the number that we write in the function. At the end, we have an approximate area calculated by counting the number of points inside the shape divided by the total number of points.
